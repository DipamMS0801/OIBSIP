📊 Unemployment Rate Analysis in India (Covid-19 Impact)

📌 Project Description

The Covid-19 pandemic significantly disrupted economic activities across India, leading to a sharp rise in unemployment.

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on unemployment data to understand time-based, state-wise, and region-wise trends, with a special focus on the Covid-19 period.

The project demonstrates how Data Science techniques can be applied to analyze real-world socio-economic problems.

This project is part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP).

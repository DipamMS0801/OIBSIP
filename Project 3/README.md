**Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

📌 Project Overview

Car price prediction is a real-world machine learning regression problem where the price of a car is predicted based on multiple factors such as brand value, features, engine power, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and year of manufacture.

This project builds and evaluates machine learning models to accurately predict car prices using historical data.



🎯 Objectives

Understand the factors affecting car prices



Perform data preprocessing and feature encoding



Train machine learning regression models



Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains car-related attributes such as:



Year



Present Price



Kilometers Driven



Fuel Type



Seller Type



Transmission



Owner



Selling Price (Target Variable)



🔄 Project Workflow

Import required libraries

🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

Linear Regression



Random Forest Regressor



Random Forest performed better due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships.



📊 Evaluation Metrics

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)



Mean Squared Error (MSE)



R² Score



📈 Results

The Random Forest model achieved higher accuracy compared to Linear Regression



The model successfully predicts car prices with good reliability

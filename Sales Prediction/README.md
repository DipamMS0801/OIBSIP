# 📊 Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description

Sales prediction plays a vital role in business planning and decision-making. Companies invest in advertising across multiple platforms such as **TV, Radio, and Newspaper**, and predicting future sales based on this spending helps optimize marketing strategies.

In this project, a **Machine Learning regression model** is built to predict product sales using advertising expenditure data. The project demonstrates the complete **data science workflow** from data analysis to model evaluation.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze the relationship between advertising platforms and sales
- Build a machine learning model to predict future sales
- Evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics
- Gain insights to support data-driven advertising decisions

## 🗂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains advertising expenditure and corresponding sales values.

| Column Name | Description                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| TV          | Advertising spend on TV         |
| Radio       | Advertising spend on Radio      |
| Newspaper   | Advertising spend on Newspaper  |
| Sales       | Product sales (Target variable) |

## 🧠 Machine Learning Details

- **Learning Type:** Supervised Learning
- **Problem Type:** Regression
- **Algorithm Used:** Linear Regression

## 🛠 Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Project Workflow

1. Imported required Python libraries
2. Loaded and inspected the dataset
3. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Visualized feature correlations
5. Split data into training and testing sets
6. Trained a Linear Regression model
7. Evaluated the model using regression metrics
8. Predicted sales for new advertising data

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**

A higher R² score indicates better prediction accuracy.

## 📌 Key Insights

- TV advertising has the highest impact on sales
- Radio advertising shows moderate influence
- Newspaper advertising has relatively less effect
- Linear Regression performs well for this dataset

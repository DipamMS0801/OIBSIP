🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning classification model that predicts the species of an iris flower based on its physical measurements.  
The model classifies flowers into the following three species:

- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

This project is part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP).

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:

- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

Target Variable:

- Species of Iris flower

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- Type: Supervised Learning (Classification)
- Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier
- Language: Python
- Platform: Google Colab
